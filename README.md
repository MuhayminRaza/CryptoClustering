# CryptoClustering

This challenge required us to do the following major tasks: 
1. Prepare the Data
2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
4. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data


The following code was written with the help of a TA: 
clusters_PCA = KMeans_model.predict(PCA_data_df)
